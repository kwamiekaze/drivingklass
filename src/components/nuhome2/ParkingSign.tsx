/**
 * The parking-lot sign: the twin of the exit sign (ExitSign.tsx), in the same place (top right of the screen, just under the header) and the same navy-and-gold glass.
 * It is on offer while the school car is in the front lot (on its way to its stall, or parked in it). Pressing it sends the car to the back lot: if it is still driving
 * it carries on down its own path and diverts (park.ts, requestEnter), and the "!" markers of the back lot are waiting when it gets there.
 * The state lives in park.ts (not React), so it is read a few times a second.
