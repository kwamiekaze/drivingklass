/**
 * Turning wheels for the fleet cars.
 *
 * The Meshy car files are one fused mesh: the wheels are real round geometry, but they are not separate objects. So at load time each wheel is cut out of that mesh: every
 * triangle whose three corners all lie inside a wheel's disc (and outboard of the axle, where the tyre and rim are) becomes a wheel; everything else stays the body. The
 * wheels share the file's own vertex buffers (no copy of the geometry, the body just gets a shorter index list), and each one hangs on a pivot at its own centre that
 * the car turns (steering, front pair) and spins (rolling, all four). The wheel discs are found per car and stored in IMPORTED_FLEET (Fleet.tsx), in the same car space
 * `prepare()` builds: length along x, up y, ground at y = 0.
 *
 * If a car has no fit, or the cut finds too little to be a wheel, nothing is split and the car is exactly the one it always was.
